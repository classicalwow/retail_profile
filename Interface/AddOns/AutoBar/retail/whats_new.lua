[[
 - Another fix for bars not appearing (bad argument #1 to 'pairs')
 - Tweaked some logging options
 - If you're still having issues with settings being lost or bars/buttons missing,
         please attach your saved variables to an issue so I can see them
 - I'm not playing WoW, so if things are missing make sure you report them.
